# Rally Protocol Flutter SDK Example App

This is an example of using the Rally Protocol Flutter SDK in a flutter App. This app allows you to create a new EOA for a user, the EOA is encrypted, saved to device and optionally backed up from the cloud. From there you can gaslessly claim an ERC20 token and use it to purchase an NFT (also gaslessly ðŸ™Œ )

- `/app` contains the mobile app code
  - `/lib/main.dart` entrypoint for the app UI and domain logic.
  - `/lib/services/nft.dart` shows an example of how to relay an arbitrary contract through our gasless tx relayer
- `contracts` contains the simple NFT contract used for demo app

## Getting Started

This is a standard Flutter app, you can run it with `flutter run` or open it in your IDE of choice. It is only setup to support iOS and Android, no desktop or web support in this codebase. To run the app you will need to have the Flutter SDK installed and setup on your machine. You can then run `flutter pub get` to install the dependencies and `flutter run` to run the app.
